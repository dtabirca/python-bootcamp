##BLACKJACK RULES
- The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
- Cards 2 to 9 are worth their value, face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
- Player always goes first.
- Game starts with two cards for each, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
- To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
- If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
- If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
- Blackjack beats a normal 21 (from 3 or more cards).
- Blackjack usually means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet.
- If the hands are equal game is a tie.  
- Dealer will hit until 17 or higher.
